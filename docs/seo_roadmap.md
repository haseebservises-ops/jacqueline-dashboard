# How to Rank #1 on Google for "CoachFlow"

You are currently running on `localhost`, which is invisible to the internet. Google cannot see your app yet. To rank, you must follow this roadmap:

## Phase 1: Go Live (Technical Foundation)
**Status: READY ✅**
I have already implemented the SEO code (Schema, Meta Tags, Sitemap).

1.  **Register Domain**: Buy `coachflowos.com`.
2.  **Deploy App**: Host your code on a server (Vercel, Netlify, or your own hosting) and connect the domain.
3.  **Verify SSL**: Ensure the site loads with `https://`.

## Phase 2: Indexing (Tell Google You Exist)
**Status: PENDING ⏳**
Once the site is live:

1.  **Google Search Console (GSC)**: Create an account and add `https://coachflowos.com`.
2.  **Submit Sitemap**: Submit the `sitemap.xml` file I created.
3.  **Request Indexing**: Use the "URL Inspection" tool in GSC to ask Google to crawl your homepage immediately.

## Phase 3: Ranking Strategy (Beating Competition)
You are competing with "CoachFlow AI" and "CoachFlow Systems". To beat them:

1.  **Niche Down**: We optimized your title for **"High-Ticket Frameworks"**. You will rank for *this* term first, before the generic "CoachFlow".
2.  **Backlinks**: Get other coaching sites or blogs to link to `coachflowos.com`.
3.  **Content**: Create a blog section later discussing "Coaching Operating Systems" or "High-Ticket Sales Tracking". 

## Summary
I have built the **race car** (Technical SEO), but you still need to **enter the race** (Deploy) and **drive it** (Marketing/Content).
